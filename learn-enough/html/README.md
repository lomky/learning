# Skimming?

I'm largely familiar with HTML. Skimming the tutorial in preparation for [LearnEnough CSS & Layout Tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial/)

## Notes

HTML is tags!  
Modern HTML prefers _semantic meaning_ in its tags, rather than explicit formatting.  
`<strong>` is better than `<b>`  
More TK on this in the CSS/Layout course.  

Continued walk through of basic tags. Valid HTMl...  

Adding images, don't hotlink in most cases.  

Neat tag: `<code>` does monospace.  

Semantic separation areas of `header`, `div`, and `span`(inline).  

Doing inline styling for the moment.
