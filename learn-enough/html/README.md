# Skimming?

I'm largely familiar with HTML. Skimming the tutorial in preparation for [LearnEnough CSS & Layout Tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial/)

Modern HTML prefers _semantic meaning_ in its tags, rather than explicit formatting.  
`<strong>` is better than `<b>`  
More TK on this in the CSS/Layout course.
