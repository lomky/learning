        <p>Seitan is tasty! <br/>
        The word seitan is of Japanese origin and was coined in 1961 by George Ohsawa, a Japanese advocate of the macrobiotic diet, to refer to a wheat gluten product created by Ohsawa's student Kiyoshi Mokutani. In 1962, wheat gluten was sold as seitan in Japan by Marushima Shoyu K.K. It was imported to the West in 1969 by the American company Erewhon.<br/>

          Futomaki (太巻, "thick, large or fat rolls") is a large cylindrical piece, usually with nori on the outside.[17] A typical futomaki is five to six centimeters (2–2.5 in) in diameter.[18] They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival, it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is called ehō-maki (恵方巻, lit. happy direction rolls).[19] By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan.[20] Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of cucumber, kampyō gourd, takenoko bamboo shoots, or lotus root.<br/>
