### Seven main principles of visual design

Developed out of the gestalt principles.

Consider how these principles are all connected. Use them to solve problems and create relationships to guide the user. 

They are _guidelines_. Not _rules_. Follow them until it makes sense not to. The larger composition as a whole is what matters most.

  1. *Alignment* - The placement of elements such that edges line up in rows/columns/center.
    - Align related things.
    - Everything on a page should be aligned in some way to the rest
  2. *Emphasis* - The focal point of the user POV
    - should usually be one item with the main emphasis
    - creates interest and pulls the interest
  3. *Hierarchy* - the relationship betwen the objects in a composition
    - differences in hierarchy should be significant enough to be percivable.
  4. *Consistency* - similar items on the page should look similar
    - helps create a mental model of the site
    - helps users quickly/easily find links
  5. *White Space* - unmarked space between elements in a composition
    - tends to look elegent & timeless
    - gives the eye a chance to rest
    - whitespace should be _active_, purposeful
  6. *Balance* - A composition is balanced when elements of optical equalibrium
    - can be symetrical or ascymetrical balance
      - symetric - folded in half the elements match up
      - asymetric - harder to implement, but more dynamic
  7. *Unity* - when all elements viewed as a whole make sense
    - last on purpose. the final check on the design

#### Critique

Critquing existing sites can help you exercise your skils.
